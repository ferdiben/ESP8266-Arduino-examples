I have been using Arduinos in projects for a number of years, some of which have included network interfaces to connect them to the big bad internet.  The great thing about the ESP8266 is that is primarily a WiFi Module which just happens to have a powerful, comparably, processor and can be connected to sensors and other applications through its GPIOs.  \r\n\r\nYou can get these modules in a number of flavours including tiny production boards and larger dev boards (NodeMCU) with Lua installed and GPIOs broken out.\r\n\r\nAfter trying Lua and NodeMCU I decided that the Arduino IDE was the way to go :)  So here are my projects to get various sensors and examples working on the ESP8266.\r\n\r\nAll are compiled using Arduino IDE 1.6.7 with the custom ESP8266 board installed and deployed to a NodeMCU dev board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Projects\r\n**BMP085**\r\n* BMP085-example-webserver\r\n  *  Connects to WLAN and starts a webserver on port 80.  \r\n  *  Calls to root URL responds with values from connected BMP085 sensor.\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
